How to build a studio Landing Page with JavaScript and GSAPâ€™S ScrollTrigger Plugin
### Why use the GSAP with the ScrollTrigger plugin?
GSAP allows you to animate anything on your website that can interact with JavaScript.
Moreover, there is a shortcoming that arises from GSAP's object animations on the website.
When the animations are played off-screen, you will notice that the animations have already started before you scroll down to the section, preventing you from seeing the act.
This led to the creation of the scrollTrigger plugin. The plugin fixes this issue by enabling you to control when the animations should be triggered.

### Creating the landing page using scrollTrigger
It would be better to become familiar with the scrollTrigger features and functions before starting to build up a landing page with it.
Some of its features and examples can be found [here](https://codepen.io/umarmuh65823803/pen/yLpOPyN).
